    <b>Fees and Tithes</b>
    <br>
    Add any Guilds, Churches or Knightly Orders you are a member of here.  Positions
    that may come from any of a number of Guilds, Churches, Schools or Knighthoods
    will be found under the 'Under council appointments' option.
    <br><br>
    Knights should select their Order first; the form will then auto-populate any
    required Church memberships.  For Roses the form will take care of synchronising
    your rank as a Rose with your rank as a Crowan Devotee.
    <br><br>
    Positions of Power should be added in addition to your regular rank in the 
    Church, Guild or Order.
    <br><br>
    Editing the fee or tithe calculated by the form will automatically exclude
    it from future automatic re-calculation.  Un-check the over-ride check box to
     to re-enable this feature.

     Rows can be removed by clicking on the little dustbin icon.
